Summary: "Eclipse Default Java Formatting"

Rationale:

Different code formatting wreaks havoc on diffs after commit:
Everything looks changed all the time.
I've added the java-formatter plugin to the main pom for this reason.

http://maven-java-formatter-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/site/0.3.1/plugin-info.html

Usage:
mvn -e com.googlecode.maven-java-formatter-plugin:maven-java-formatter-plugin:format

I use it from a Mercurial Pre-commit hook so as not to forget using it
before a commit: from my ~/.hgrc

[hooks]                                                                   
pre-commit=mvn -e com.googlecode.maven-java-formatter-plugin:maven-java-formatter-plugin:format

Using this leaves everyone free to have their own favourite formatting
in e.g. IDE's while still having a common formatting in the repository.
This is a great relief to someone like me to whom code formatted using
the default Eclipse/Sun styles looks like an RFC with modem noise.

If required, we could include a custom config XML at some point..

When using the Eclipse code formatter on default settings, according to
the docs, you should be OK without this plugin, as well. In practice
I've noticed there are small differences, mostly in empty line handling.
